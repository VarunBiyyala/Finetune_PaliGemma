## Overview

In this project, we fine-tune PaliGemma, a powerful Vision Language Model, using a vehicle dataset from Roboflow. The primary objective is to improve the model's performance in detecting and classifying different types of vehicles in various scenarios.

## Dataset

The vehicle dataset used for this project was sourced from Roboflow. It contains a wide range of images with annotations for different types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles.

## Model

PaliGemma is a Vision Language Model that integrates visual and textual information for enhanced object detection and recognition capabilities. We fine-tune this model specifically for vehicle detection tasks.

## Finetuning Process

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset from Roboflow is preprocessed, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
2. **Model Configuration:** The PaliGemma model is configured with specific parameters suitable for object detection.
3. **Training:** The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using transfer learning techniques.
4. **Validation:** The performance of the model is validated using a separate validation set to ensure generalization.

## Evaluation

The finetuned model is evaluated based on standard object detection metrics, including Precision, Recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision). 
Detailed evaluation results and analysis are provided.
The results could be improved if followed the following experiments:
1. Increase label sequence length (few labels could have been truncated when sequence length is set to 128)
2. More training.
3. The order of the label could also matter. More ordered dataset could improve the performance.
4. 
## Results

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of finetuning PaliGemma for vehicle object detection. The model shows significant improvement in detecting and classifying various types of vehicles.
